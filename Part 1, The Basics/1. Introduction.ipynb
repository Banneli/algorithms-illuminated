    "While writing this notebook I will be reading the first chapter of the book and wold summarize some programming assignments, the algorithms, extra challenge problems that I attempt and the math behind the analysis of the algorithms explained.\n",

    " We will start by looking at the Integer Multiplication problem. \n",
    " \n",
    "To multiply two numbers we need to have the following primitive operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add two single digit numbers\n",
    "- Multiply two single-digit numbers\n",
    "- Append of prepend a 0 to a number\n",

    "Following image shows how perform the following multiplication $5678 \\times 1234$\n",

    " ![Multiply](ConventionalMultiplication.png)\n",
    " \n",
    " Let us now analyze the total number of operations for multiplying two n digit numbers\n",
    " \n",
    " A partial product involves multiplying 1 digit of an n digit number with another n digit. Each multiplication involves atmost $2n$ operations where we have n multiplications for an n digit number and then an addition if a carry is generated from the previous multiplication operation.  Essentially we have $n \\times 2n$ operations giving is $2n^2$ multiply operations for multiplying two n digit numbers.\n",
    " \n",
    " We still are left with adding up these partial products. We have n rows of these partial sums and each of these n rows can have a carry giving us a maximum of 2n operations per row and thus adding up all partial sums gives is $n \\times 2n = 2n^2$ operations\n",
    " \n",
    " Thus the conventional multiplication takes $2n^2 + 2n^2 = 4n^2$ operations. Or, more generally the number of operations for performing multiplication of two n digit numbers is $Cn^ 2$ operations. Thus the work increases quadratically with the number of digits in the the number.\n",

    " \n",
    " Let us look at an alternate way to multiply two numbers known as *Karatsuba Multiplication*. We will us ethe same two numbers 5678 and 1234 and see Karatsuba Multiplication in action.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Break up these two 4 digit numbers into halfs, thus we get 4 smaller numbers of 2 digits each. We call them a, b, c and d. Thus for the above example, 5678 will be split in two numbers 56 and 78 and we call them a and b respectively. Similarly, 1234 will be split into c and d with values 12 and 34 respectively.\n",
    " - Compute $a \\times c$ which is $56 \\times 12 = 672$\n",
    " - Compute $b \\times d$ which is $78 \\times 34 = 2652$\n",
    " - Compute $(a + b) \\times (c + d)$ which is $(56 + 78) \\times (12 + 34) = 6164$\n",
    " - Subtract the first two results from the third, thus we get $6164 - 672 - 2652 = 2840$\n",
    " - Compute $10^4 \\times 672 + 10^2 \\times  2840 + 2652 = 7006652$\n",
    " \n",
    " The above result is exactly same as the one we got using the conventional method.\n",
    " \n",
    " ---\n",
    " \n",
    " Before we implement the Karatsuba multiplication, let us implement a recursive approach to multiply two numbers.\n",
    " Let the two number be n digit numbers x and y, to keep the initial implementation simple, we assume both the numbers are n digits but can easily be extended to two numbers of different number of digits.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Let x and y be split into two $n/2$ digit numbers a, b and c,d respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus \n",

    "\n",
    "$x.y = (10^ {n/2}.a + b) \\times (10^ {n/2}.c + d) = 10^n.ab + 10^{n/2}.(a.d + b.c) + b.d $\n",

    "Following code snippet ``rec_int_mult`` implements this recursive multiplication of two numbers. But first we will be defining a simple function which will take a number and pad it with leading 0 so that the length of the number if a power of 2 for simplicity in recursion"
