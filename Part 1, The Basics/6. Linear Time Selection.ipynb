    "### Linear Time Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will look at two types of selection algorithms, the RSelect, or the randomized selection algorithm and a deterministic version called DSelect. But before we proceed the question is \"What is selection?\" A selection problem aims to find the $i^{th}$ smallest number for n given numbers. The simplest approach would be to sort the input array and then select the $i^{th}$ position number essentially doing the selection in $nlogn$ time. This however is not the optimum way as selection if an easier problem than sorting and thus we should achieve this in much less running time than sorting. To select a number from n given numbers, we will have to view all the numbers at the minimum and thus $O(n)$ is a reasonable lower bound and we know that sorting can be done in $O(nlogn)$ which is an upperbound for our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we do something to possibly perform the selection in $O(n)$ time? Let us implement the selection problem using the partition routine we used in quick sort.\n",
