    "### Linear Time Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will look at two types of selection algorithms, the RSelect, or the randomized selection algorithm and a deterministic version called DSelect. But before we proceed the question is \"What is selection?\" A selection problem aims to find the $i^{th}$ smallest number for n given numbers. The simplest approach would be to sort the input array and then select the $i^{th}$ position number essentially doing the selection in $nlogn$ time. This however is not the optimum way as selection if an easier problem than sorting and thus we should achieve this in much less running time than sorting. To select a number from n given numbers, we will have to view all the numbers at the minimum and thus $O(n)$ is a reasonable lower bound and we know that sorting can be done in $O(nlogn)$ which is an upperbound for our problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we do something to possibly perform the selection in $O(n)$ time? Let us implement the selection problem using the partition routine we used in quick sort.\n",

Once we know that value, we can then recurse on the left or the right split after the pivot. In the best case suppose we end up picking the median of the input array as pivot, in which case the array will be split in exactly halves.

This shows us that if we get an approximate median and split the array into two approximately equal pieces, we can expect the selection problem to run in linear time.

The maximum value of phase j when the value of the input size will be 1 should be $log_{4/3}n$.\n",

Thus we can conclude, picking an approximate median is guaranteed to take us to next phase.\n",
